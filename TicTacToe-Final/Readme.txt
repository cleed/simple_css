Major Challenges:
	One major challenge was finding a way to keep track of the win conditions.
	This includes setting up and using an array, as well as implementing a
	series of nested if-statements to ensure all cases are covered.
    Another thing that was challenging was updating the draggable attribute
    for the clone image. This was eventually solved by assigning unique
    id's for each clone image after appending a count number.

						The Chinese Zodiac, also known as Sheng Xiao, is based on a twelve-year cycle calculated according to the chinese calendar.
						Each year in the cycle corresponds to an animal. These animals are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog,
						and pig. The years represented by the animals are believed to affect the characteristics of the people in the same manner as the signs of zodiac
						adopted by western civilizations.

						"Why is 12 the magic number?" One may ask. That is partially because in ancient China, divisions were mostly related to the number 12. One year has 12 months, 
						one day has 12 time periods called Shi Chen, and ancient people observed that there are 12 full moons per year. Given these, as well as that the moon's cycle
						was observed to repeat every 12 years, it was natural to have a 12-year cycle, represented by 12 different animals. Each animal is also believe to have a 
						different set of connections with the five elements, and corresponds to an unique time period (Shi Chen) of the day.
